# Banking Risk Analytics — Python, SQL & Power BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **banking risk analysis** by leveraging **Python** for data preparation, **SQL** for querying and aggregating data, and **Power BI** for visualization.  
It integrates **DAX measures** and **KPI metrics** to deliver actionable insights into **loan performance**, **client engagement**, and **deposit trends**, supporting strategic decision-making in the banking sector.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze **loan portfolio health** and identify possible **risk exposures**.
- Track **client engagement trends** and **deposit behaviour**.
- Build **dashboards** to monitor **loan performance, delinquency rates, and client activity**.
- Provide **strategic recommendations** based on historical and current data.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: Banking datasets (loans, clients, deposits)
- **Size**: ~50K+ records
- **Key Tables/Columns**:
  - Client ID, Client Demographics
  - Loan ID, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Loan Status
  - Deposit Amounts & Dates
  - Account Activity & Transactions
  - Risk Category

## Process & Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python & SQL)
- Removed null/duplicate records.
- Standardized column formats (dates, categories, numerical fields).
- Merged multiple datasets (loans, deposits, clients).
- Normalized categorical data for Power BI use.

### 2️⃣ KPI Calculation & Measures (SQL & DAX)

### 3️⃣ Dashboard Development (Power BI)
- **Loan Portfolio Dashboard** — Monitors total loan amount, delinquency rates, and default percentages.
- **Client Engagement Dashboard** — Tracks active/inactive clients, transaction volumes, and deposit activity.
- **Risk & Trends Dashboard** — Highlights high-risk loan segments, deposit patterns, and client churn trends.
- Added **drill-downs, slicers, and date controls** for dynamic analysis.

---

## Key Insights
- **High-risk loan category** accounted for ~18% of total portfolio.
- Customers with **low deposit frequency** had higher default probability.
- **Seasonal trends** indicated Q4 surge in both loan applications and defaults.
- Targeting mid-tier clients with engagement campaigns could reduce churn by ~12%.
